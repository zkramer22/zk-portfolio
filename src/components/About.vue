      <h2>~ about ~</h2>
      <p>
          I'm a 26-year old software developer from Philadelphia
          with a creative mind and a passion for technology.

          After attending college and working as a freelance musician
          and producer for a few years, my fascination with software
          development became more and more apparent. I got my footing
          by developing business solutions with FileMaker Pro for a small
          software company called The Tricon Group in Garnett Valley, PA.

          In January of 2018 I made my move to NYC and attended
          <a href="http://appacademy.io" target="_blank">App Academy</a>, one
          of the nation's top software development bootcamps.

          Fast forward to 2020: I've worked as a frontend developer for <a href="https://onemagnify.com" target="_blank">OneMagnify</a>
          and <a href="https://gsw-w.com" target="_blank"><nobr>GSW Worldwide</nobr></a>,
          where I've fine tuned my skills with design, development, animation,
          and more â€“ all while collaborating with expert level UX designers,
          account managers, and other dev teams.
          With my creativity and abundance of skills &amp; knowledge all around
          the stack, I am confident that I can be a valuable asset to any development team
          building tomorrow's web technologies from the ground up.
